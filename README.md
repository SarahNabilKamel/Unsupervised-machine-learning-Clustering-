   - Explanation of the algorithm.
   - Implementation using Scikit-Learn.
   - Step-by-step implementation from scratch.
   - Code implementation with visualization.
   - Advantages and limitations.
   - Pros and cons.
   - References and further reading.

2. **Hierarchical Clustering** 🔵
   - Introduction to Agglomerative and Divisive clustering.
   - Implementation using Scikit-Learn.

   - Advantages and limitations.
   - Pros and cons.
   - Additional learning materials.

3. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)** 🟡
   - Understanding density-based clustering.
   - Implementation using Scikit-Learn.
   - Step-by-step implementation from scratch.
   - Code implementation with visualization.
